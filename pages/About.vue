						<h2>About the Building</h2>
						<p>With 10 bedrooms and sleeping space for up to 28, this historical landmarked mansion, built in 1852, recently underwent comprehensive renovations. It's completely updated with modern amenities, and luxuriously appointed. Some of the many modern additions include an exercise room; billiards parlour; poker room; conservatory; dry sauna; 25 ft custom-built indoor shuffleboard; ping pong table; and heated outdoor pool. You'll have to visit to see the rest.</p>
